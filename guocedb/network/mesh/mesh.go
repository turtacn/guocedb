package mesh

// This package is a placeholder for service mesh integration.
// A service mesh can provide features like:
// - Service Discovery: Automatically discover other nodes in the cluster.
// - Load Balancing: Distribute traffic intelligently across nodes.
// - mTLS: Secure communication between nodes with mutual TLS encryption.
// - Distributed Tracing: Propagate trace contexts across service calls for observability.
// - Traffic Management: Implement advanced routing, retries, and circuit breaking.

// InitServiceMesh would initialize the connection to the service mesh control plane
// or sidecar proxy (e.g., Istio's Envoy proxy).
func InitServiceMesh() error {
	// No-op for now.
	// In a real implementation, this might involve:
	// - Reading environment variables injected by the mesh (e.g., ISTIO_META_*).
	// - Configuring gRPC clients to use the mesh's service discovery mechanisms.
	// - Setting up handlers to extract and propagate tracing headers (e.g., B3 headers).
	return nil
}

// GetMeshDialOptions would return gRPC dial options needed to communicate with
// other services through the mesh.
// func GetMeshDialOptions() []grpc.DialOption {
// 	// This could configure things like:
// 	// - A custom resolver for mesh service discovery.
// 	// - mTLS credentials provided by the mesh.
// 	return []grpc.DialOption{}
// }
